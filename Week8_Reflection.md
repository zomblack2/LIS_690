# Reflection

This assignment was fairly straightforward an I have installed apache, PHP, and mySQL on servers before.
Trying to set a password for the root user in MySQL was a pain, though, and I'm still not quite sure how to do it. 
I think that I understand the instructions but may not *really* get why I'm doing what I'm doing so I'll definitely be posting more on Element this week for help.
