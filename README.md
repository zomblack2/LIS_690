## LIS 690 - Systems Librarianship

This repository is for my LIS 690 Systems Librarianship course at University of Kentucky.  
I am taking it in the Spring of 2024 as an elective to learn more about library systems and systems administration.
I will record all of my assignments in the *documentation.md* file and split them into sections.
